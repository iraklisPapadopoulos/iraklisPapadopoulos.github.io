A Horizon Europe project ([click here](https://www.dioptra-project.eu/)), aiming to revolutionise Colorectal Cancer screening via a holistic, personalised and accessible method for early detection.
DIOPTRA aims to introduce a front-line screening tool that will consider risk factors and protein biomarkers for pinpointing individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence. Tissue & blood samples will be examined towards a discriminative set of prognostic proteins that are detectable via standard bloodwork and can indicate a need for further evaluation (i.e. colonoscopy). Other data (e.g. medical, behavioural) will also be considered as potential risk factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) will be leveraged for assessing prognostic power, while personalised behavioural change will be promoted based on modifiable risk factors. Given the low citizen participation in CRC screening across the European Union, DIOPTRA seeks to broaden the evaluated population, boosting participation rates and bypassing age screening thresholds.
